# Moeen-2 — FINAL Handoff Document (v3 — Complete with Competitor HAR Analysis)

> **Status (May 18, 2026):** API path works for Activity-only. The COMPLETE 4-asset flow (Activity + Enrichment + Homework + Exam) has been fully reverse-engineered from a captured competitor HAR. Implementation ready.
>
> **Next chat's job:** Implement multi-asset support + n8n AI content integration, using the exact payloads and sequence documented below.

## 🛠️ Workflow Constraint (CRITICAL)

The user has an **autonomous AI Agent in VS Code (Antigravity / Claude Code)** that executes file changes. The user does NOT edit files manually.

When you have a solution, **DO NOT give conversational copy-paste snippets**. You MUST generate a **STRICT, READY-TO-USE PROMPT in English** for the VS Code Agent, wrapped in a code block, including:
1. Target file name.
2. Explicit "DO NOT rewrite the whole file."
3. Exact **Find** block.
4. Exact **Replace with** block.
5. Verification `grep` commands.
6. `node --check content.js` as final syntax validation.

## 📦 What is Moeen-2?

Chrome extension that automates lesson preparation on Saudi Madrasati (`schools.madrasati.sa`). Goal: silently prepare 24 lessons in one click.

**Killer features:**
- ✅ Bulk (24 lessons)
- ✅ Silent (background API)
- 🔧 AI content via n8n (NEXT)
- 🔧 Multi-asset (Activity + Enrichment + Homework + Exam) (NEXT — fully reverse-engineered, ready to implement)

---

## ✅ What's CURRENTLY Working (verified May 18, 2026)

A complete API flow that ships ONE Activity per lesson and saves successfully:

```
1. Scrape CSRF + HashKey from /Projects/Projects/Create
   - Scoped via hashKeyEl.closest('form') — Madrasati has multiple __RequestVerificationToken
     inputs across forms; naive selector picks an empty one.

2. fetchProjectsListSnapshot('before-create')
   - Baseline of existing ProjectIds for this lesson scope.

3. POST /Projects/Projects/Create → 302 (success)
   - Id="" (NOT "0")
   - ProjectType sent TWICE: "2" then ""
   - hfLevelsCount="3" (hardcoded)

4. Wait 2000ms for DB sync.

5. fetchProjectsListSnapshot('after-create')
   - New set; size = baseline + 1.

6. DIFF: after − before → our new ProjectId.

7. Fetch /SchoolSchedule/Schedule/ManageLecture
   - Scrape Save form's base FormData (~61 fields).

8. POST /Teacher/Lessons/MlutiLessonPlan (note typo "Mluti")
   - Returns enriched form HTML + StartDate.

9. Inject critical fields into FormData:
   - SubjectId + SelectedUnitId (BOTH required, same value)
   - LessonType = "2"
   - LessonTempleateType = "1"
   - LectureProjectsList[0].ProjectId = <DIFF result>
   - LectureProjectsList[0].Name = "واجب"
   - LectureProjectsList[0].StartTime/EndTime (parsed from MultiPrepareLesson[0].StartDate, +3 days)
   - 5 hardcoded Arabic strings (preparation, vocabulary, thinking, closing, teacher note)

10. POST /Teacher/Lessons/SaveLastLessonPlan → 302
    - alert_type=1 in cookie = success
    - alert_type=2 = error (decode alert_message cookie for Arabic field names)

11. Refresh dashboard → card turns GREEN ✅
```

**Files in scope:** `content.js` (main logic), `background.js` (caching).

# 🆕 NEW: Full 4-Asset Flow (Reverse-Engineered from Competitor HAR)

This is the **gold-standard flow**. Each section below has the EXACT POST payload captured from a working competitor save.

## 🔢 Complete Request Sequence (11 POSTs, ~6 seconds total)

Captured timing (May 18, 2026 06:23:51 → 06:23:57):

T+6000ms POST /Teacher/Lessons/SaveLastLessonPlan                     → 302 ✅
```

**Implementation strategy for Moeen-2 (recommended):**
- Use BEFORE/AFTER snapshot DIFF for each list (Projects, Assignments, Exams) — same pattern that's already working for Activity.
- Run Activity / Enrichment / Homework / Exam creates SERIALLY (avoid race conditions).
- Skip ExamSettings + ExamQuestionSettings + AddQuestionListPaging — these are UI-render endpoints, not state-changing. The actual `/Manage` POST is what creates the resource.
- The Captcha is NOT required (we verified saves work without it on May 18). Skip the `recaptcha/api2/reload` step.

## 🅰️ Asset 1: Activity (نشاط) — ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint:** `POST /Projects/Projects/Create`
**Result:** 302 to `/Projects/Projects/Index/{schoolHash}?hfLevelsCount=3`
**ID extraction:** DIFF on `GetProjectsList` (already working).

**Payload (20 fields):**
```

## 🅱️ Asset 2: Enrichment (إثراء) — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint:** `POST /LearningResources/MangeResources/Create`
**Result:** 302 to `/LearningResources/MangeResources/Index/{schoolHash}`
**ID extraction:** DIFF on a NEW snapshot endpoint (probably `GetActivitiesList`, needs verification).

**Pre-requirement:** Call `POST /LearningResources/MangeResources/GetGoalLessonSubject` first to get the `SelectedGoles` base64 blob (or build it from goals discovered via the existing `GetGoalLessonSubject` flow we already have for the Quran fix).

**Payload (15 fields):**
```
__RequestVerificationToken   = <from MangeResources/Create page>
Id                           = 0                # NOTE: enrichment uses "0", NOT "" like Activity!
IsEduResource                = true
SelectedUnitId               = <subjectId>
SelectedGoles                = <base64 JSON>    # [{"GoalId":47509,"LessonId":26682},...]
ActivityType                 = 1
Name                         = إثراء: <lessonName>
Description                  = إثراء: <lessonName>
IndicativeWords              = <base64>         # encoded keyword phrase
TypeId                       = 1
FileType                     = 1
Link                         = <YouTube URL>    # competitor uses real YouTube ien link
hfLevelsCount                = 1                # NOTE: 1, not 3!
hfDrawTree                   = /MangeResources/DrawTreeToClassLesson
SchoolId                     = <hash>
```

**SelectedGoles structure (before base64):**
```json
[
  {"GoalId": 47509, "LessonId": 26682},
  {"GoalId": 47510, "LessonId": 26682},
  {"GoalId": 47511, "LessonId": 26682}
]
```
Encode with `btoa(JSON.stringify(arr))`.

**IndicativeWords:** Arabic keyword phrase, encoded with `btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(text)))` for UTF-8 safety.

## 🅲 Asset 3: Homework / Assignment (واجب) — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint:** `POST /Teacher/Assignments/Manage?Length=11`
**Result:** 200 (NOT 302 like the others!) — response likely contains the new AssignmentId. Verify via DIFF on GetAssignmentsList.
**ID extraction:** DIFF on `GetAssignmentsList` (new helper, mirror of fetchProjectsListSnapshot).

**Payload (31 fields):**
```
Grade                              = 1
SaveButton                         =
IdEnc                              =
Id                                 = 0

SelectedTrees_2                    = <chapterId>
SelectedTrees_3                    = <lessonId>
Name                               = واجب (<lessonName>)

PageNumber                         =
QuestionsNumber                    =
SolvingType                        = 4
AccessType                         = True
schoolId                           = <hash>
hfLevelsCount                      = 3
hfDrawTree                         = /Teacher/Assignments/DrawTreeToClassLesson
X-Requested-With                   = XMLHttpRequest    # YES, this is in the FORM body, not header
AssignmentQuestionsList[0].Id      = <questionId>      # e.g. 311348 — must come from AddQuestionListPaging
AssignmentQuestionsList[0].Grade   = 1
AssignmentQuestionsList[0].IsIenQuestion = True
IsEditDraft                        = False
IsDraft                            = false
```

**Pre-requirement:** Call `POST /Teacher/Assignments/AddQuestionListPaging` first to get available ien questions for this lesson. The response provides the question IDs (`AssignmentQuestionsList[0].Id`).

**No HashKey or __RequestVerificationToken in this payload** — the endpoint uses URL `?Length=11` query param as one form of state, and relies on session cookies.

## 🅳 Asset 4: Exam (اختبار) — NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Endpoint:** `POST /Teacher/Exams/Manage`
**Result:** 200 (not 302). Response likely contains the new ExamId. Verify via DIFF on GetExamsList.
**ID extraction:** DIFF on `GetExamsList`.

**Pre-requirement (2 POSTs first):**
1. `POST /Teacher/Exams/ExamSettings` — returns `{"success":true, "html":"...", "notFoundGoals":[]}` — UI setup, may need to extract HashKey from response HTML.
2. `POST /Teacher/Exams/ExamQuestionSettings` — returns available questions and difficulty distribution.

**Payload (70 fields, most are question metadata):**
```

## 💾 Final Save: SaveLastLessonPlan (143 fields)

**Endpoint:** `POST /Teacher/Lessons/SaveLastLessonPlan`
**Result:** 302 → `/SchoolSchedule/Schedule/ManageLecture?...&classroomId=<id>` with `alert_type=1` cookie = success.

The key additions for multi-asset support are the **4 separate list arrays**:

### NEW: LectureProjectsList (Activity)
```
LectureProjectsList[0].ProjectId    = <from DIFF on GetProjectsList>
LectureProjectsList[0].Grade        = 1
LectureProjectsList[0].StartTime    = 5/17/2026 8:11:00 AM       # M/D/YYYY format
LectureProjectsList[0].EndTime      = 5/20/2026 8:11:00 AM       # +3 days

```
This is NOT a separately-created resource. The `ActivityId_Enc` comes from ien content metadata returned by `MlutiLessonPlan`. We currently don't include it; adding it is part of the quality pass.

### Goals and Activities (from MlutiLessonPlan + GetGoalLessonSubject)

activities                                  = 49490
...
```

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Notes

### 1. The "Activity" we create is NEW every time
`Id=""` on the Activity POST creates a fresh row. Bulk-saving 24 lessons creates 24 new Activity records in the teacher's account. NOT a blocker, but it accumulates.

### 2. Multi-asset selection should be user-driven
The popup UI should let the teacher choose which asset types to attach per lesson (checkboxes for Activity / Enrichment / Homework / Exam). The bulk save loop creates only the selected ones.

### 3. Use DIFF strategy for EVERY list
The Tier-A DIFF pattern (before/after snapshot of GetXxxList) is the only reliable way to identify newly-created IDs. We've proven this for `GetProjectsList`. Mirror the pattern for:
- `GetActivitiesList` (probably not needed — Activity is the same as Projects)
- `GetAssignmentsList` (for Homework)
- `GetExamsList` (for Exam)

### 4. CSRF token scraping (DO NOT FORGET)
Every Create page has multiple `__RequestVerificationToken` inputs across forms. Always scope via HashKey:
```js
const hashKeyEl = doc.querySelector('[name="HashKey"]');
const form = hashKeyEl?.closest('form');
const token = form.querySelector('[name="__RequestVerificationToken"]')?.value;
```

### 5. Madrasati's typos (preserve them!)
- `/Teacher/Lessons/MlutiLessonPlan` ← "Mluti" not "Multi"
- `LessonGoalsAndActivity[0].lesssonId` ← three s's, not two

### 6. Captcha is OPTIONAL
The competitor sends a reCAPTCHA token. We've verified saves succeed without it. Skip the recaptcha calls entirely unless Madrasati starts enforcing.

### 7. The 5 hardcoded Arabic strings are the n8n integration point
File: `content.js`, around line 1965-1969. Single fetch to n8n webhook before the appends, replace each string with the AI-generated content.

### 8. The competitor uses real ien content
- Activity `Link` = real PDF URL from `iencontent.ien.edu.sa/Storage/PdfFiles/...`
- Enrichment `Link` = real YouTube URL from ien channel
- We currently use placeholder URLs. The n8n workflow can return these per-lesson.

### 9. ee10_lesson_templates.json is DEAD
Not used by the silent API path. Safe to delete from the new project.

## 🚀 Recommended Roadmap

### Session 1: n8n AI Integration (start here, lowest risk)
Replace the 5 hardcoded Arabic strings with `fetch(n8nWebhook, ...)`.
File: `content.js`, before line 1965.

**Before writing the agent prompt, ask the user:**
1. n8n webhook URL (localhost? deployed?)
2. Exact JSON response shape from n8n
3. Fallback behavior if n8n offline: use defaults / abort / retry?
4. For bulk save: pre-fetch all 24 lessons' AI content in parallel, or sequentially per lesson?

### Session 2: Enrichment Endpoint
Add `silentCreateEnrichmentResource()` mirroring `silentCreateActivityResource()`.
Use the payload spec from this document. DIFF on a new snapshot helper.

### Session 3: Homework Endpoint
Add `silentCreateHomeworkResource()`. Note `Manage?Length=11` URL quirk.
DIFF on `GetAssignmentsList`.

### Session 4: Exam Endpoint
Add `silentCreateExamResource()`. Requires 2 pre-POSTs (ExamSettings + ExamQuestionSettings).
DIFF on `GetExamsList`.

### Session 5: Popup UI for asset selection
Checkboxes per asset type, applied to all 24 lessons in the bulk run.

### Session 6: Polish
- Progress bar.
- Per-lesson retry on failure.
- Per-subject default strategies/teachingTools.

## 🧠 Key Learnings (DO NOT FORGET)

1. **302 from `/Projects/Projects/Create` is SUCCESS.**

2. **`alert_message` cookie is the source of truth for Save errors.** URL-decoded JSON contains exact field names. `alert_type=1` = success, `alert_type=2` = error.

3. **CSRF token MUST be scoped to the right form via HashKey.closest('form').**

4. **GetXxxList endpoints return ALL existing items for the lesson scope, not just new ones.** DIFF strategy is mandatory.

5. **Madrasati cookies became HttpOnly** (SemesterId, IsClassRoomAdmin, etc.). JS can't read them, but they're sent automatically with fetch. Not a blocker.

6. **`hfLevelsCount` varies per endpoint:**
   - Activity Create: `"3"`
   - Enrichment Create: `"1"`
   - Homework Manage: `"3"`
   - Exam Manage: `"3"`

7. **Madrasati often sends fields TWICE** (ProjectType, ExamCategory, ExamType, AllowLessonContent). The duplicate-empty trick is real. Replicate exactly.

8. **The VS Code Agent (Antigravity) sometimes claims to apply changes without actually doing so.** ALWAYS include `grep` verification in every agent prompt.

9. **AddQuestionListPaging endpoint** provides question IDs for Homework. Question IDs for Exam come from `ExamQuestionSettings` response.

10. **The Moeen-2 DOM extension (separate) supports all 4 asset types via UI automation.** It's a backup, not the primary path. Goal is to bring API path to feature parity.

## 🗂️ Project Files

### Keep:
- `content.js` — main extension logic
- `background.js` — service worker
- `madrasati_courses_clean.json` — subject lookups
- `manifest.json`
- `popup.html` / `popup.js` — extension UI

### Delete:
- `ee10_lesson_templates.json` — dead code (DOM path only)
- `ee10_data.js`, `extract_ee10_data.js`, `ee10_extracted.json` — same
- `competitor.js`, `decryptCompetitorPayload.js` — RE artifacts, archive only
